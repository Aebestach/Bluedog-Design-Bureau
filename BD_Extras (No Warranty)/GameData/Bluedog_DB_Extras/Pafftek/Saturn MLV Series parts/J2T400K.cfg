			name = J-2T-400K
			title = Sarnus-HE2JT-400K "Tohces" Cryogenic Aerospike
			description = A development of the Dnoces engine, the Tohces reuses a number of components such as turbopumps, while exchanging the bell-shaped thrust chamber for an annular aerospike. The result is a slightly lighter engine, with higher ISP. The 400K sub-variant, is able to perform gimbaling using a hydraulic thrust structure.
			addedcost = 6700
			real_title = J-2T-400K Annular Aerospike
			real_description =  The third experimental variant of the Annular Aerospike J-2T family, the -400K has 400,000 Pounds of thrust.  The higher thrust is achieved by utilizing a strenghted and higher velocity J-2S powerhead and improved oxygen/fuel mixing before combustion.
			real_manufacturer = North American Aviation Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International.
