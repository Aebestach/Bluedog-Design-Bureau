// Origional Patch by Zorg, edited by Pappystein.  Note this patch does not currently allow decal placement on the CELV or SLV3X parts.
// that will require significant editing in the modles I believe.  For this same reason the Bossart Atlas main tank (with the side saddles) does not
// support decales inspite of this patch.

// Patch for users who want to surface attach to Atlas tanks. We better not see you use it for things other than decals ;)

// This updates Zorg's origional patch to isolate just atlas rocket parts and not other Balloon tanked parts.
//   It is an alternative to an earlier suggestion I made on the subject, to prevent "cross talk" between rockets that are patched with variables.
// As with Zorg's origional patch this only works for fuel containing tanks that are of the TankType bdbBalloon.   But now it is also rocket family discriminatory
