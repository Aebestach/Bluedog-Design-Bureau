//An optional patch to add AJ9 subtype to the lr87-AJ5 (closest visual analogue)
// Major Upgrade to Zorg's origonal AJ9 patch to include the LR87 and LR91 AJ-11.
// Removal of the LR91-AJ-9 as it is non-distinct, except in bell color from AJ-5 or AJ-7
// Updated By Pappystein
// Titan IV Upgrade to unlock these parts are in seperate file in same file folder
