description = The Material Experiment Stowage Assembly is a complete, semi-automated material science laboratory designed to be stowed in the MLEM. MESA contains several different experiments designed to test basic principles of manufacturing in the Munar vacuum and low gravity, and the hardiness of certain materials when exposed to the space radiation environment. As a bonus, it also serves as an excellent way of collecting extra surface samples in the form of statically charged dust! It also has a well-placed television camera for observing those tremendous first few steps onto the surface of another world.
