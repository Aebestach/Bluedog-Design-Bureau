	description = Advanced probe-and-drogue docking system. It possesses the smallest crew tube possible for Kerbals (their heads would get stuck if it were any smaller) crammed inside a 0.625m form factor. It would probably be better to have a larger passageway on cargo flights. Once soft docking is achieved and the vessels properly aligned, retract the probe to hard dock and establish a solid connection.
