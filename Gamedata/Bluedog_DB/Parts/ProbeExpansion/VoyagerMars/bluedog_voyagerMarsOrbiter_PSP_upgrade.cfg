	description = Upgraded orbital science package for the Nomad orbiter . Features mostly the same instruments as the baseline version including infrared spectrometers, an ultraviolet spectrometer, and an infrared radiometer. However the primary imaging system has been upgraded from Vidicons to a high resolution film camera and accompanying built in scanner.
