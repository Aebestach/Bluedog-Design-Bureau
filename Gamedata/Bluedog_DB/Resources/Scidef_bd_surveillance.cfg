	RESULTS
	{
	default = You take a picture of whatever the telescope is pointing at. Do you see anything suspicious?

	SunInSpaceHigh = She is very bright and very beautiful. Kerbol, the star that keeps Kerbalkind alive...
	SunInSpaceLow = The light coming off Kerbol has made the image pure white! You're lucky you didn't damage the camera...

			//These are custom, most of the rest are still from the BD camera experiment.
			KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = The grassland plains are the most 'alive' part of Kerbin. The cities, the lush green grass, the farmland, and the industry. This is home.
			KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = You really can see your house from up here! Oh, there's your annoying neighbor.
			KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = Observed farmland. Crop yields look up to 10 percent higher than last year.
			KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = Mapped some enemy roads. Should be useful if we ever go on an offensive.
			KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = Observing Kerbograd apartment buildings, doesn't seem to be any different than the ones in Filigrad and Yurigrad. In fact, they look exacty the same.
			KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = Observed military parade in Kerya. Weapons being developed are a concern, but their current capabilities don't seem to pose any real threat.
			KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = Found some stray kogs around Woomerang. Maybe they can be used as test subjects.
			KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = This part of the grasslands is exactly that. Grassy. There are some small farms here, seems like their crop was recently harvested.
			KerbinInSpaceLowShores = The shallow waters near the coast are teeming with sea life. You can see schools of different fish, some koral, and seaweed.
			KerbinInSpaceLowShores = You can see the water from the rivers merge into the sea. You can see the cloudy dark blobs on some of those rivers.
			KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = Spotted what looks to be an observatory complex on a mountaintop. Its dome is closed for now.
			KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = Found a group of climbers. They seem to be surveying the rocks. Grade: mostly harmless.
			KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = Nothing of interest to national defense, just barren rock, but the fact that we can get to places where even the mountains look small is a testament to the accomplishments of society.
			KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = The highlands. The nature, the farms, the rolling hills. You can see the plants growing.
			KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = You can see the highland cities, and the tourism they are built on.
			KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = Snapped photo of a kerman with a largish telescope, pointing directly at the satellite. Amateur astronomer, probably. But why is he still looking up after dawn?
			KerbinInSpaceLowDesert = The desert looks hostile, but there are flourishing cities and settlements dotted across it, a reminder that anything can be done with enough will, time, and resources. The third, the desert has plenty.
			KerbinInSpaceLowDesert = Found some nomads on kamels, resting by an oasis. Not a threat.
			KerbinInSpaceLowDesert = Staring at what seems to be a mass of granular silicon dioxide. Are you sure you want to waste surveillance-grade film on this?
			KerbinInSpaceLowDesert = Spotted enemy rocket test! Fortunately for us, it failed just under a minute after liftoff.
			KerbinInSpaceLowWater = The boats and ships crossing Kerbin's waters seem mostly benign.
			KerbinInSpaceLowWater = You can see the containers on the freighters, kerbs on ferries and the aircraft of a carrier.
			KerbinInSpaceLowWater = You spot a lone boat in the middle of the ocean. What is it doing?
			KerbinInSpaceLowWater = Snapped high-detail photos of the latest algae bloom. Its spread can be accurately determined from this image.
			KerbinInSpaceLowWater = All is calm this time, just a light breeze over the ocean and fish swimming underneath.
			KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = Photographed some rocks, a tree, and a mining town.
			KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = Captured images of oil wells among the rocks. May be important later.
			KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = Spotted an airbase, large. Site marked as 'important'.
			KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = This particularly treacherous, rocky view shows why this place is called "the Badlands". it really is bad.
			KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = You photographed a silo. Probably nuclear ICBM. You've also captured some tracks left behind by lorries servicing the silo.
			KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = Trees, a bear, and some snow. Normal tundra stuff.
			KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = Just some rocks and a tent.
			KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = You get a very washed-out, fuzzy image from the bright white ice, so the high resolution image is utterly worthless here.
			KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernIceShelf = Ice, ice, and more ice. And what's that? A 50-kerb Krussian outpost? Probably harmless. `
			KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernIceShelf = Big glacier splitting off. Better put on some navigation warnings and inform the KOAA.
			KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernIceShelf = You see some polar bears and seals. One seems to be eating the other.
			KerbinInSpaceLowSouthernIceShelf = Captured sub-meter resolution image of... ice. And some flocks of birds. And their kuano. At least you know where the ice is cracking.
			KerbinInSpaceLowSouthernIceShelf = Spotted the latest polar expedition. They seem to be all fine, but they got their snowcat stuck a few times.
			KerbinInSpaceLowSouthernIceShelf = Big crack spotted and... ice falling! At least the penkuins are safe.
			KerbinInSpaceLow = Collected very high-res images. You can discern cars, roads, rivers and even kerbholes from space!
			KerbinInSpaceLow = Kerbin looks beautiful from up here. But we're not interested in that. we're here for spying - oh, sorry, scratch that - science!
			KerbinInSpaceLow = Captured some interesting details on the planet's surface.

			MunInSpaceLowMidlands = The surface is littered with small impact craters. The flat areas here may have been formed by volcanic activity.
			MunInSpaceLowMidlandCraters = You wonder how big of an asteroid is needed to make craters this wide, before realizing there are far larger craters on the Mun.
			MunInSpaceLowHighlands = The highlands are lighter in appearence, but no sign of enemy bases here.
			MunInSpaceLowHighlandCraters = Some of these craters look to be far older than the ones in the Mun’s midlands.
			MunInSpaceLowCanyons = The steep walls of the canyons might make landing difficult. But it would be a good place to hide a base in.
			MunInSpaceLowNorthernBasin = The basin was likely formed by volcanic activity.
			MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = One of the most prominent landmarks on the Mun when viewed from the surface of Kerbin, Kerbals have spent millennia guessing what might have created it.
			MunInSpaceLowNorthwestCrater = Just another impact crater, located in the northwest.
			MunInSpaceLowSouthwestCrater = Just another impact crater, located in the southwest.
			MunInSpaceLowFarsideCrater = You reflect on how you’re the first kerbal to see this part of the Mun.
			MunInSpaceLowTwinCraters = Despite their similarity, these craters may have been created millions of years apart
			MunInSpaceLowEastFarsideCrater = The crater is nicely framed by Kerbin rising over the horizon.
			MunInSpaceLowPolarCrater = Unlike the rest of the Mun’s craters, this one is far from the equator.
			MunInSpaceLowPoles = Not much different from the rest of the mun, except that some parts of the polar region receive sunlight almost year round
			MunInSpaceLowPolarLowlands = Lower areas near the poles might contain water ice where craters are kept in eternal darkness. Or not. Its not like you can see anything in them.
			MunInSpaceLow = Closer to the moon now, you see that craters have ravaged the surface. But does this image show any evidence of enemy mun bases?

		MinmusInSpaceLow = Minmus reveals varying terrain. High plateaus stretch for kilometres and the plains below them stretch even farther.
				MinmusInSpaceHigh = From so far away, Minmus resembles a small scoop of mint ice cream...

		MohoInSpaceLow = Craters become clear on Moho's surface. With immense detail, the craters have craters. This reminds you that you are too close for comfort...
			MohoInSpaceHigh = Moho floats far away, punished with craters. You can almost see the heat of the home star, Kerbol...

				EveInSpaceLow = Eve greets you with great delight as you swoop past, revealing how vast her Explodium Oceans are. You now want a grape popsicle...
					EveInSpaceHigh = Eve shimmers with its purple hue down below you. Or was it up? You can't remember...

		GillyInSpaceLow = Gilly, a beige captured asteroid reveals very extreme terrain. A blur in the photo shows its fast rotation.
			GillyInSpaceHigh = Gilly barely resembles a dot in the photo.

				DunaInSpaceLow = Duna has a vide variety of terrain, ranging from deep chasms, to tall mountain ranges, and plains. Its ice caps are large and dominant of the poles.
					DunaInSpaceHigh = The pale orange dot resembles a ball or rust, or a red velvet cupcake...

		IkeInSpaceLow = Ike shows its weathered terrain quite clearly. Mountain ranges dominate the surface while the plains come in dark, large patches.
			IkeInSpaceHigh = The rock we call Ike is massive. It appears to be quite dense from so far away. It also appears to have very rugged terrain, more so than your own moon.

		DresInSpaceLow = Closer to Dres now, you begin to collect evidence that she is not a planet, but she is a dwarf planet which once was a gargantuan rogue asteroid.
			DresInSpaceHigh = Dres reminds you of the Mun. It holds quite uneven terrain with a grey hue.

			JoolInSpaceLow = The green hue of Jool dominates the photo with great immensity.
				JoolInSpaceHigh = Jool's many moons are seen fantastically before her like a ballet of crumbs around that key lime cake you just devoured.

				LaytheInSpaceLow = Laythe has islands, water, and an atmosphere. You wouldn't be suprised if we found microkerbals here...
					LaytheInSpaceHigh = From here, Laythe looks like a pale blue marble.

			VallInSpaceLow = Vall holds blue plains and lighter blue mountains ranges that snake around the planet's surface in every which way.
				VallInSpaceHigh = Vall stands valiant, far away, as a pale blue dot.

		TyloInSpaceLow = Tylo is humongous. It is a massive rock the size of Kerbin. The speckles turn out to be tens of thousands of craters. Tylo reveals a highly beaten surface like the Mun. The scientists in the lab infer that Tylo does indeed have trace amounts of cobalt.
			TyloInSpaceHigh = Tylo, from so far out, appears to be speckled. Why didn't we name it Spot?

		BopInSpaceLow = Bop appears to reveal a crater with a white rim, which perhaps, could be evidence of a young captured Bop in a young Joolian system.
			BopInSpaceHigh = Bop seems to be a brown captured asteroid not unlike Gilly. Perhaps they are related?

		PolInSpaceLow = Pol seems unforgiving. Like her sister Bop, she seems to be a captured asteroid. The rough, jagged, and derranged terrain make you think twice about landing.
			PolInSpaceHigh = Pol, the speck across the way, reminds you of a pollen grain.

		EelooInSpaceLow = Eeloo shows its true self as you approach, revealing her ice canyons and chasms.
			EelooInSpaceHigh = Eeloo appears to be very icy. It's spent too long this far away from Kerbol.
