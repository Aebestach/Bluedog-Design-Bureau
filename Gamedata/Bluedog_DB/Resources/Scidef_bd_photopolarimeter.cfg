	RESULTS
	{
		default = Collected and recorded Spectroscopy data from the environment.

		MohoInSpace = The Photopolarimeter failed to operate.
		MohoSrfLanded = The Photopolarimeter failed to operate.

		EveInSpace = Eve is bright because a dense layer of clouds covers it.
		EveSrfLanded = This wavelength reveals cloud structure at ~29 kilometres altitude.

		GillyInSpace = The Photopolarimeter failed to operate.
		GillySrfLanded = The Photopolarimeter failed to operate.

		KerbinSrfLanded = You have detected a planet-wide layer of submicrometer aerosols of substantial visible optical thickness, of the order of 0.05 to 0.1

		MunSrfLanded = The Photopolarimeter failed to operate.


		DresInSpace = The Photopolarimeter failed to operate.
		DresSrfLanded = The ambient light data may include ambient light intensity data, ambient light spectrum data and/or ambient light direction data.

		JoolInSpace = The planet has a surprisingly strong electric field.

		LaytheSrfLanded = This light is measured and provides a mesure of the ammonia present.

		VallSrfLanded = The Photopolarimeter failed to operate.

		TyloInSpace = The light detector is in the detecting layer, and is configured to receive light and generate light data associated with the received light.
		TyloSrfLanded = The Photopolarimeter failed to operate.

		BopSrfLanded = The light data is emitted sporadically, and a waveform is reconstructed from the sporadically sampled light data.

		PolInSpace = In one embodiment, for example, an optical sensing system selects an operational configuration by detecting a pattern embodied in received light data and comparing the detected pattern to one or more internally stored patterns.
		PolSrfLanded = The processor reconstructs an image of the object based on the time-varying light data.

		EelooInSpace = The operational mode may be selected based, at least in part, on ambient light data.
		EelooSrfLanded = The Photopolarimeter failed to operate.
